# Fitness Data Hub Group Project - README

## Introduction

This repository contains the group project for the DBMS course titled "Fitness Data Hub." The project focuses on designing and implementing a comprehensive database management system for a fictional gym. The aim is to create a centralized platform that efficiently manages and analyzes data related to gym operations, members, trainers, equipment, classes, and fitness goals.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `database`: Contains the SQL scripts for creating the database schema, tables, and relationships.
- `documentation`: Contains project documentation, including the project proposal, design specifications, and user manual.
- `source-code`: Contains the source code for the database management system, including backend logic and user interface components.
- `sample-data`: Contains sample data files that can be used to populate the database for testing purposes.

## Project Requirements

To run the Fitness Data Hub project, the following requirements must be met:

- A DBMS system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle.
- A web server or application server to host the user interface.
- Programming languages and frameworks as specified in the project documentation.
- Access to a web browser for accessing the user interface.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required DBMS system and create a new database.
3. Execute the SQL scripts in the `database` folder to create the necessary tables and relationships.
4. Configure the connection settings for the DBMS system in the project source code.
5. Set up the web server or application server to host the user interface.
6. Deploy the source code to the server and ensure that it is properly configured.
7. Populate the database with sample data from the `sample-data` folder, if needed.

## Usage

1. Access the deployed user interface using a web browser.
2. Register as a gym administrator, trainer, or member depending on your role.
3. Log in to the system using the provided credentials.
4. Explore the different features and functionalities of the Fitness Data Hub, including member management, class scheduling, equipment tracking, and data analysis.
5. Follow the user manual provided in the `documentation` folder for detailed instructions on using the system.
